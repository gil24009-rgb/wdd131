      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Site Name</h3>
      <p><strong>Find Your Major</strong></p>

      <h3>Site Topic / Short Description</h3>
      <p>
        Find Your Major is a small web application that guides users through a short visual test to help them
        discover which major categories fit their interests and strengths. The experience is built around
        potato characters, simple questions, and a clear result screen with twelve major categories.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 03 Purpose and Audience -->
    <section id="purpose-audience" class="section">
      <h2>Purpose &amp; Audience</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is to make choosing a major less overwhelming and more playful.
        Through a sequence of ten questions and friendly potato characters, the site leads users to one of
        twelve major categories and gives them a starting point for further exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of presenting a long list of majors, the site simplifies the decision-making process into clear
        steps so that users can quickly see which areas might be a good fit and feel more confident about
        their next academic and career decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The primary audience is high school students and first–year college students who are not sure which
        major to choose yet. A secondary audience includes international students, parents, and academic
        advisors who want an easy visual tool to talk about majors together.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience Scenarios</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A student who likes drawing and design but is unsure whether to choose Graphic Design, UX, or Illustration.</li>
        <li>A student who enjoys math and solving problems and wants to know the difference between Computer Science, Data Science, and Engineering.</li>
        <li>An international student who wants a quick overview of majors that match their personality and long–term goals.</li>
        <li>A parent or advisor who wants something simple to show during a conversation about possible majors.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 04 Dynamic Elements -->
    <section id="dynamic-elements" class="section">
      <h2>Dynamic Elements (JavaScript Plan)</h2>

      <h3>Overall Flow</h3>
      <p>
        The site will use JavaScript to control the flow of the test:
        a start screen with six potato characters, followed by ten questions, three loading-style screens,
        and finally one of twelve result pages. All screens will be rendered dynamically in the same
        main area, without reloading the page.
      </p>

      <h3>Question Structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Start Screen:</strong> A single start screen with the “Touch to START!” message and six potato characters.
          When the user presses the start button, JavaScript moves to the first question.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Branch Questions (Q2–Q5):</strong>
          These questions branch the user into different paths.
          Question 2 has 2 versions, Question 3 has 4 versions, and Questions 4 and 5 each have 8 versions.
          Question 4 is mainly used to deepen the branch but does not strongly affect the final result logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Common Questions (Q6–Q10):</strong>
          Questions 6–10 are the same five questions for every branch.
          The same five images and texts are reused, and JavaScript keeps track of the answers for scoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loading / Transition Screens:</strong>
          Between the last question and the result, three potato loading-style screens will be used.
          A text like “Digging up potatoes...” will animate while the site calculates the result.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Result Pages:</strong>
          At the end, the user sees one of twelve result pages. Each result represents a major category
          (for example: Humanities &amp; Languages, Communication &amp; Media, Performing Arts, Computer Science &amp; Data,
          Science &amp; Math, Engineering &amp; Applied Technology, Education, Business, Psychology &amp; Social Science, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Planned JavaScript Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Structures:</strong>
          Questions and results will be stored as JavaScript objects and arrays.
          Each question node will include its id, step number, image path, and next question ids for “yes” and “no”.
          Each result object will include its id, category name, description, example majors, and result image.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ES Modules and Functions:</strong>
          The code will be organized into ES modules such as <em>questions.js</em>, <em>results.js</em>, and <em>quizFlow.js</em>.
          Functions like <code>goToNextQuestion()</code>, <code>renderScreen()</code>, <code>calculateResult()</code>,
          and <code>renderResult()</code> will keep the logic organized.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DOM Interaction &amp; Events:</strong>
          JavaScript will select the main container and replace its HTML content when the user clicks “Yes”, “No”,
          or “Next”. Event listeners will be attached to buttons on each screen so that the UI feels like a
          continuous app instead of separate pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conditional Branching:</strong>
          The branching from Q2 to Q5 will use conditional logic to move along the correct path.
          Each branch will eventually map to one of the twelve major categories, which will be used to render the result.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arrays and Array Methods:</strong>
          Arrays will be used to store the list of majors inside each category and to manage the list of result cards
          on the child page. Methods like <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>filter</code> will be used to
          generate result cards, filter by interest tags, and prepare display data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optional Enhancement – Favorites:</strong>
          Users will be able to “save” a result or major category to a small favorites list.
          This data can be stored in <code>localStorage</code> so that the favorites appear again
          when the user returns to the site.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="branding" class="section">
      <h2>Branding &amp; Visual Assets</h2>

      <h3>Logo Concept</h3>
      <p>
        The logo for “Find Your Major” is based on six potato characters gathered together with the title text.
        The title (“Find your major”) and the “Touch to START!” text are separated into their own image assets
        so they can be reused in different layouts.
      </p>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <p>
        The color palette is designed to feel warm, approachable, and slightly playful, while still being
        readable and suitable for an academic context. The vertical palette image is used in the prototype
        to keep the main colors consistent.

        <div class="font-sample font-body">
          <h4>Body Font: System Sans (Arial / Helvetica / sans-serif)</h4>
          <p class="example">
            Descriptions, question text, instructions, and result explanations will use a neutral sans-serif
            typeface to keep the content easy to read on both mobile devices and desktops.

          clear “Start Test” button.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Test / Result Page (Child Page):</strong>
          The interactive test itself (Questions 2–10, loading-like transitions) and the final result screen with the
          major category. This page may also include a “See All Categories” section at the bottom.

        <li>Question text and illustration image for each question.
          Q1 and Q10 will use <code>Q1.png</code> and <code>Q10.png</code> as base illustrations with text rendered in HTML.</li>
        <li>Two large buttons for “Yes” and “No” (or similar responses) that move to the next question node.</li>
        <li>Loading / transition sequence with the potato loading-style screens and the text “Digging up potatoes...”.</li>

  image: "images/COMM_result.png"
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Each result category will be defined as an object like the example above. An array of these objects will
